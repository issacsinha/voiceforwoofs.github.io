        <h1>Why you should adopt a dog loitering in the streets?</h1>
        <img src="images/loitering.jfif" />
        <p>
          Why should you adopt a dog loitering in the street when you can buy
          various breeds from the pet shop?
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a fundamental difference between buying a dog and adopting
          one, when you are buying a dog you are actually weighing it against
          some amount of money which is nothing compared to the unconditional
          love, loyalty and companionship which he has to offer for his whole
          life, and this is not a thing a true dog lover would do. So, when you
          are planning to bring a dog and if you are a true dog lover, the very
          thought of buying a dog should never cross your mind as the thought
          itself is immoral.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, if you are planning to adopt a dog, why not adopt a furry friend
          living around your house who wags his tail on seeing you for you might
          have fed him a couple of biscuits once or twice or you feed him
          regularly, as he is already a lot familiar with you and will prove to
          be a good pet no doubt once you adopt him. He will not only be loving,
          playful, loyal,protective like the other pedigree(purely breeded) dogs
          infact he will be better as he will be more smart, less picky about
          food, he will be adaptable to living conditions easily and will
          require less maintainence as he will be resistant to a lot of
          diseases. He may not mean the world to you but for him you will always
          be his whole world. It is a sad thing to know that the condition of
          stray dogs who have been abandoned or who were born there, is pathetic
          they don’t get proper nutrition have to search in trash for some food,
          have no acess to medical facilities when they are sick or hurt and
          have to live in drastic climatic conditions on the road, not to forget
          about the human torture that they are subjected to, a lot of them die
          facing a hard life on the streets or even in cruel roadside accidents.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, this way you will not only be getting yourself a furry best friend
          for your life but you will also be contributing to a good social cause
          by uplifting the condition of stray dogs and by breaking the
          stereotype and setting an example for the people around you which in
          turn may also encourage them to adopt a stray.
