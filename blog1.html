          Why you should adopt a puppy from a shelter?
        </h1>

        <p>
          There's a reason dogs are known as man's best friend, they're
          adorable, loyal, and simply the best. But instead of visiting your
          local pet store, there are a lot of reasons you should hit up a
          shelter in honor of Adopt a Shelter Dog.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the ASPCA, approximately 670,000 dogs are euthanized
          every single year. You can save a dog's life (or two!) by choosing to
          adopt rather than buying your pet from a breeder.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shelter and rescue animals are in need of a second chance. They are
          lost, given up or abandoned. They are unwanted and helpless. You give
          them a new life in a loving home and at the same time, you make room
          at the shelter for another pet in need of a second chance.Just because
          many shelter dogs were raised on street or in abusive families doesn't
          mean they will love you any less, shelter dogs go through
          socialization training to learn how to interact with people and other
          animal and how to remain calm in stressful situations .
        </p>

        <p>
          When you buy a pet, you not only deny a homeless pet a home, you are
          supporting an industry that thrives on short-changing the welfare of
          animals. There are not enough homes for all the animals that are born
          every year. More than 8 million animals are euthanized each year.
          Shelter and rescue pets are spayed and neutered,and you help to break
          the cycle of overpopulation. Every community requires an animal
          shelter and rescue organizations. When you adopt a pet from a shelter
          or rescue you assist a not-for-profit organization and will send a
          message to others who will be asking you for years to come where you
          obtained your adorable pet.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the old saying says ,dogs are man's bestfriend you will love your
          shelter pet as one of your own and they will happily return the favor.
