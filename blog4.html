        <h1>Why you should adopt a senior dog?</h1>
        <img src="images/senior.jfif" />
        <p>
          What comes to our mind when we think of getting a dog? A puppy perhaps
          or even a young dog. We tend to ignore senior dogs due to various
          misconceptions regarding them.
        </p>
        <p>
          A dog falls into the “senior” category around age seven. However, we
          should keep the size of the dog in consideration. Smaller dogs take
          more time to mature up than larger dogs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seniors make up the bulk of the 1.2 million dogs put down in shelters,
          it is a fate that they most definitely do not deserve.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you’re thinking about picking up a dog from your local shelter,
          don’t look past the older dogs. They make great pets for a number of
          reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Senior dogs at shelters need homes just as badly as younger dogs.
          Many older dogs were once owned and loved by someone. For whatever
          reason, they were given up and abandoned in a shelter and are in need
          of a home. Just like puppies and younger adoptable dogs, they make
          loyal and loving companions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, it's a myth that senior dogs are problem dogs, they're often
          abandoned due to reasons which are absolutely unrelated to their
          behavior, reasons such as their owners are unable to keep them for
          reasons including: the novelty of owning a dog wearing off, allergies,
          death of a guardian, a new baby, loss of a job, a move, change in work
          schedule, and various other lifestyle changes. These dogs need homes
          just as badly as young adoptees do, and make wonderful household pets.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Adopting an older dog may save their life. Many people are quick to
          adopt puppies and younger dogs, often overlooking dogs over the age of
          five. Shelters are overcrowded and unfortunately, older dogs often
          tend to pass away without receiving the love they deserve. Why not
          adopt one and lavish them with the same amount of adoration which is
          due to every dog?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Older dogs usually come trained and understand at least basic
          commands. Most older dogs are potty-trained! Adopting an
          already-trained dog will save you a lot of time and energy that you’d
          normally have to dedicate towards training a young dog.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. You can teach an old dog new tricks. Dogs can be trained at any age
          and older dogs are just as smart as younger ones. Older dogs have a
          greater attention span than a puppy, which makes them easier to train!
          However, do keep in mind that their energy levels won't be as high as
          a puppy's or a younger dog's.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Older dogs are calmer and less energetic than younger dogs. Older
          dogs also won't "surprise" you, you'll get what you see. Older dogs
          have all their adult teeth and are out of the energetic puppy phase,
          which will result in less destruction to your home. Many of them do
          well with young children as they have a lower energy level and have
          possibly lived with them in their past homes.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Older dogs make instant companions. An adult dog will make a great
          workout partner, a loyal companion, and a late night snuggle buddy.
