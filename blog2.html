        <h1>Why you should adopt an Indian Pariah Dog?</h1>
        <img src="images/pariah.jfif" />
        <p>
          Before knowing why to adopt an Indian pariah dog one must know what is
          actually an Indian pariah dog. Indian pariah dog has many names such
          as South Asian dog or the desi dog, desi kutta or Pye dog. Dogs which
          are mostly seen on the streets in India belong to the Indian pye dog
          breed. They have erect ears, a wedge-shaped head, and a curved tail.
          These dogs are also used as police dogs and guard dogs as they are
          easy to be trained.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indian pariah dogs originally belong to the Indian subcontinent. They
          have short coat and a lifespan of about 10 to 13 years. Both the male
          and female dogs are different from each other in their weights and
          heights . The males usually weigh around 15 to 35 kilograms in the
          female weigh almost around 15 to 25 kilograms. And the height of the
          males is around 20 to 25 in and similarly for the females it is 18 to
          23 in. The most commonly observed colours are browns, ranging from
          dark to reddish-brown, with or without white markings. Solid blacks
          are rare, but some dogs are pied. Shaded coats, brindles, solid white
          and dalmatian-type spotting are never seen in pure populations. These
          may be a sign of mixing with modern breeds, as they are only seen in
          dogs in cities and other sites where non-native dogs have been
          introduced.
        </p>
        <p>
          So now, why should one adopt an Indian pariah dog? Being a naturally
          evolved breed, they have very few health concerns and thrive with
          minimal maintenance in suitable climates. They adjust well in tropical
          climates as there is a mix of both winters and summers. But, even
          extreme weather conditions do not affect them in any way. They don't
          need much cleaning and grooming 'cause they are adapted to clean
          themselves on their own and also they have little body odour. Genetic
          health ailments like hip dysplasia are extremely rare, since there is
          no inbreeding and the dominant genes that aid their survival are
          naturally selected over time. Most of their deaths occur due to
          accidents on the roads and railway tracks, not getting food or
          drinking polluted water, tumors in the body, getting bit by snakes or
          being beaten up by humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          So it becomes very convenient for the adoptive individual to raise an
          Indian pariah dog because they require less grooming and are also not
          prone to much diseases. It just costs about Rs 500/- to Rs. 1000/- to
          give a good life to an Indian pariah dog . In return the adoptive
          parent gets a best friend who will love unconditionally for his entire
          life and be a loyal pet. The only thing they ask is sufficient food,
          shelter, love and care from their adoptive parent.
